## 🌌 About The Project

The **Mars Cydonia Connection** is a comprehensive web platform dedicated to exploring the enigmatic Cydonia region on Mars. This region gained worldwide attention after NASA's Viking 1 orbiter captured images in 1976 showing what appears to be a humanoid face and pyramid-like structures.

This project aims to:
- Present scientific data and historical information about the Cydonia region
- Explore the famous "Face on Mars" and surrounding structures
- Provide a timeline of discoveries and missions related to Cydonia
- Create a community for researchers and enthusiasts interested in Mars anomalies

Whether you're a scientist, researcher, or simply curious about the mysteries of our neighboring planet, this website offers valuable resources and insights into one of Mars' most fascinating regions.
