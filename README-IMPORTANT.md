# IMPORTANT: How to View the Changes Made to the Website

## Issue: Changes Not Showing on the Webpage

You mentioned that you're not seeing the changes that were made to the website. This is because the project has two
separate versions:

1. **Traditional HTML/CSS/JS files** in the `html` directory
2. **React application** in the root directory

The changes we made were to the React application components, but you might be viewing the traditional HTML version of
the site.

## How to View the React Application with the Changes

To see the changes that were made (including the new Forum page and other enhancements), you need to run the React
application:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory (where this README file is located)
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if you haven't already)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

4. This will start the development server and automatically open the React application in your browser
   at http://localhost:3000

5. If the browser doesn't open automatically, manually navigate to http://localhost:3000

## What Changes Were Made

The following changes were implemented:

1. Created a new dedicated Forum page with enhanced features
2. Updated the navigation to include a direct link to the Forum page
3. Implemented a simple routing mechanism to switch between pages
4. Ensured the Forum page maintains the Mars theme and styling

## Project Structure Explanation

This project appears to have both a traditional website (in the `html` directory) and a modern React application (in the
root and `src` directories). The changes were made to the React version, which is the more modern implementation.

If you want to deploy these changes to a production website, you would need to:

1. Build the React application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your web server
