# Mars Cydonia Connection Website - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes implemented to enhance the Mars Cydonia Connection website based on the recommendations in the `recommendations.md` file. The focus was on implementing the "Short-term Wins" identified in the recommendations.

## 1. Progressive Web App (PWA) Implementation

- **Added a service worker** (`service-worker.js`) that enables offline functionality by caching important assets like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **Created a web app manifest** (`manifest.json`) that provides metadata about the web application, making it installable on users' devices.
- **Implemented caching strategies** in the service worker to serve cached content when offline and update the cache when online.
- **Updated the HTML** to register the service worker and link to the manifest file.

## 2. Image Optimization Pipeline

- **Added width and height attributes** to images to prevent layout shifts during loading.
- **Implemented lazy loading** for images that are below the fold to improve initial page load performance.
- **Note:** WebP format and responsive images with srcset were not fully implemented as they would require creating new image files.
